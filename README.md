*How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?*

I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by creating tests that will pass all aspects of theprogram. There are diferent types of testing. I would choose automation testing to ensure functionality and security of testing measures.

*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?*


I may interpret user needs and implement them into my programs by reading the requirement sof the user many times. I may also have face to face discussions about theh wants to make sure my implementations are up to par for each project. 


How do I approach designing software?

I will approach designing software by writing psseudocode before the actual uimplemetation. Also, UML diagrams, flow charts, process models, and user stories will most certainly help to keep me on track. All of these will allow me to organize the flow of data and the process fo code before starting. This will mitigate getting stuck and not knowing where to go next during implimeation.
